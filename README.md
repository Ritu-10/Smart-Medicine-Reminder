# Smart-Medicine-Reminder  

This is a simple project I built using *Java, DSA concepts, and Spring Boot REST API*.  
The goal is to help people remember their medicines on time.  

##  Why I built this ?
Many people, especially elderly or busy professionals, forget to take their medicines.  
This app works like a reminder + tracker where users can:  
- Add their medicines with time  
- Get reminders for each dose  
- Mark whether they took it or not  
- Track missed doses easily  

## Tech Stack  
- *Java (Core + OOP + DSA)*  
- *Spring Boot (REST APIs)*  
- *MySQL Database*  
- *Postman (API Testing)*  

## Features  
- Add / Edit / Delete medicine schedules  
- Track which medicines are taken or missed  
- REST APIs for managing reminders  
- Data stored securely in database  

##  Future Plans  
- Add push notifications / SMS alerts  
- Simple mobile UI for easier access  
- Generate weekly health reports  

## This project is not just a coding exercise, but also a *real-life helper*.  
## It can reduce stress for people who depend on regular medication-
